"""
Frontend renderers: turn ChaBo's internal event stream into a wire format.

The graph emits a small typed event stream (data / filters_applied / sources / error / end).
`_consume_stream` (ui_adapters.py) is the single consumer of that stream and owns the output
guards; a *renderer* owns the separate question of what those semantic outputs look like on
the wire. Adding a frontend is therefore a new renderer, not a fork of the streaming logic.

Two renderers ship today:

  MarkdownRenderer     plain markdown text, one string per event. Used by the LangServe
                       routes (ChatUI) and, with `trailing_flush_delay=0`, to build the
                       message body of a non-streaming OpenAI response.
  OpenAIChunkRenderer  `chat.completion.chunk` SSE frames for /v1/chat/completions.

Both render sources the same way — inline `[N]` markers in the answer plus a markdown source
list — because that is the only citation rendering that works in every frontend. Anything
richer (the `citations` array below) is layered on top as a best-effort enhancement.

Renderer methods return the wire text to emit, or None for "nothing to emit". A renderer is
per-request: it carries stream identity (OpenAI id/created) and collects `citations`.
