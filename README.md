# ChaBo

A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) orchestrator API built with FastAPI, LangChain, and LangGraph. ChaBo orchestrates embedding, vector search, reranking, and LLM generation to answer queries using retrieved context.

```

**Pipeline:** Query → Embed → Extract Filters* → Smart Search → Rerank → Generate (with citations)

> **Smart Search** applies LLM-extracted metadata filters to narrow Qdrant results before reranking. Filters are pulled from the current query, with conversation history as fallback. `*` Activated only when `filterable_fields` is configured under `[metadata_filters]` in `params.cfg` — omit or leave empty for standard unfiltered search.

**Supported LLM Providers:** HuggingFace, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Azure OpenAI

## Deployment

### Option 1: Backend Only (HuggingFace Spaces / Standalone)

Deploy ChaBo as a standalone API using the root `Dockerfile`. This is the setup used on HuggingFace Spaces, where a frontend (e.g. ChatUI) runs separately.

**Prerequisites:** Remote HuggingFace Inference Endpoints for embedding and reranking, an existing Qdrant instance, and API keys.

#### Configuration

Edit `params.cfg` with your service endpoints:

```ini
[hf_endpoints]
embedding_endpoint_url = https://your-embedding-endpoint.huggingface.cloud
reranker_endpoint_url = https://your-reranker-endpoint.huggingface.cloud

[qdrant]
mode = native
url = https://your-qdrant-instance.cloud.qdrant.io:6333
collection = your_collection

[retrieval]
initial_k = 20
final_k = 5

[generator]
PROVIDER = huggingface
MODEL = meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct
MAX_TOKENS = 1024
TEMPERATURE = 0.1
INFERENCE_PROVIDER = ABC
ORGANIZATION = XYZ
CONTEXT_META_FIELDS = filename,project_id,document_source
TITLE_META_FIELDS = filename,page

[metadata_filters]
filterable_fields = project_id:str,year:int,tags:list
```

Pass API keys as environment variables at runtime:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `HF_TOKEN` | Yes | HuggingFace API token |
| `QDRANT_API_KEY` | Yes | Qdrant API key |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | If using OpenAI | OpenAI API key |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | If using Anthropic | Anthropic API key |
| `COHERE_API_KEY` | If using Cohere | Cohere API key |
| `AZURE_API_KEY` | If using Azure OpenAI | Azure OpenAI API key |

#### Build and Run

```bash
docker build -t chabo .
docker run -p 7860:7860 \
  -e HF_TOKEN=your_token \
  -e QDRANT_API_KEY=your_key \
  chabo
```

---

### Option 2: Full Stack with Docker Compose

Run ChaBo with a [ChatUI](https://github.com/huggingface/chat-ui) frontend as a single stack. Docker Compose profiles optionally add local embedding/reranking (TEI) and a local Qdrant instance — so you can go fully self-contained with no external dependencies beyond an LLM provider.

#### Configuration

Configuration is split across three files:

- **`params.cfg`** (repo root) — Qdrant connection, retrieval parameters, generator/LLM settings, and ingestor chunking config. This is the same file used in Option 1, but when using local TEI or local Qdrant, the endpoint URLs in `.env` override what's in `params.cfg`.
- **`docker-compose/.env`** — API keys, Compose profiles, and endpoint overrides for local TEI containers.
- **`docker-compose/chatui.env.local`** — ChatUI frontend settings (app name, model endpoints, UI options).

Set up the Docker Compose files:

**1. Environment file** — controls backend services and Compose profiles:

```bash
cp docker-compose/.env.example docker-compose/.env
```

Edit `docker-compose/.env`:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `HF_TOKEN` | Yes | HuggingFace API token |
| `QDRANT_API_KEY` | Yes | Qdrant API key |
| `COMPOSE_PROFILES` | No | Comma-separated profiles to enable (see table below) |
| `TEI_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | If using local TEI | Model ID (default: `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`) |
| `TEI_RERANKER_MODEL` | If using local TEI | Model ID (default: `BAAI/bge-reranker-base`) |

Embedding and reranker endpoint URLs are configured in `params.cfg` under `[hf_endpoints]`. When using local TEI, set them to `http://tei-embedding:80` and `http://tei-reranker:80`.

**2. ChatUI config** — controls the frontend app name, model endpoints, and UI settings:

```bash
cp docker-compose/chatui.env.local.template docker-compose/chatui.env.local
# Edit chatui.env.local to customize (endpoint URLs are pre-configured for the Docker network)
```

#### Compose Profiles

Profiles add optional services on top of the base stack (ChaBo + ChatUI):

| Profile | Services added | Use case |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| `local` | `tei-embedding` (port 8081), `tei-reranker` (port 8082) | Self-hosted embedding and reranking instead of remote HF endpoints |
| `infra` | `qdrant` (port 6333) | Local Qdrant instance instead of a remote one |

Set profiles in `.env` (e.g. `COMPOSE_PROFILES=local,infra`) or via the CLI.

> **Important:** When using local TEI, the embedding model (`TEI_EMBEDDING_MODEL`) must match the model used to create your Qdrant collection. Mismatched models will produce poor search results.

#### Build and Run

```bash
# Start base stack (ChaBo + ChatUI, using remote HF endpoints and remote Qdrant)
docker-compose -f docker-compose/docker-compose.yml up --build

# Start with local TEI embedding/reranking
COMPOSE_PROFILES=local docker-compose -f docker-compose/docker-compose.yml up --build

# Start fully self-contained (local TEI + local Qdrant)
COMPOSE_PROFILES=local,infra docker-compose -f docker-compose/docker-compose.yml up --build
# or docker-compose -f docker-compose/docker-compose.yml --profile infra --profile local up -d --build

# Run in detached mode
docker-compose -f docker-compose/docker-compose.yml up -d --build

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose/docker-compose.yml logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose -f docker-compose/docker-compose.yml down
```

**First run with local TEI:** The TEI containers download models on first startup (1-3 minutes depending on model size). Models are cached in Docker volumes, so subsequent starts are fast.

**GPU support:** The default TEI images are CPU-only. For GPU acceleration, edit `docker-compose/docker-compose.yml` and swap in the GPU image variant (see comments in the file).

#### Data Upload

To populate a Qdrant collection with your embedding data, place your data file at `data/data.parquet` and run:

```bash
docker exec -it docker-compose_chabo_1 python src/components/ingestor/upload_parquet.py \
    --file data/data.parquet \
    --collection YOUR_COLLECTION_NAME \
    --vector_size 1024
```

> **Note:** Use the same collection name as in your `params.cfg` and the correct vector dimension for your embedding model (e.g. 1024 for BGE-large, 768 for BGE-base).

#### Service URLs

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| ChatUI | http://localhost:3000 | Chat frontend |
| ChaBo API | http://localhost:7860 | Backend API |
| API Docs | http://localhost:7860/docs | Interactive documentation |

## Non-HTTPS Deployments

When deploying to a server without HTTPS (e.g. a VPS accessed via IP address), ChatUI needs two settings to avoid 403 errors:

1. Set `UI_ORIGIN` in `docker-compose/.env` to your server's URL (e.g. `http://your-server-ip:3000`). This tells SvelteKit the expected origin for CSRF protection.
2. Uncomment `ALLOW_INSECURE_COOKIES=true` in `docker-compose/chatui.env.local`. This allows session cookies over plain HTTP.

Not needed behind HTTPS (e.g. HuggingFace Spaces, or behind a reverse proxy with TLS).

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | API information |
| `/health` | GET | Health check |
| `/docs` | GET | Interactive API documentation |
| `/chatfed-ui-stream` | POST | Text query streaming (LangServe) |
| `/chatfed-with-file-stream` | POST | File upload + query streaming (LangServe) |


## Health Checks & Testing

The `tests/health/` directory contains scripts to verify your setup before or after deployment. These run **locally outside Docker**, against already-running services, using the project's virtual environment.

### Prerequisites

Before running any health checks ensure:
1. Services are up — Qdrant, embedding endpoint, reranker endpoint
2. `params.cfg` is configured with correct endpoint URLs and collection name
3. Required env vars are exported (`HF_TOKEN`, `QDRANT_API_KEY`, etc.)

### Setup

```bash
# Navigate to repo root — required for src/ imports to resolve
cd /path/to/chabo

```

### Running the full health suite

```bash
python tests/health/run_all.py
```

`run_all.py` checks each component in order and prints a pass/fail summary:

| Step | Check | What it verifies |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | Qdrant | Reachable and configured collection exists |
| 1 | Embedding endpoint | Returns a valid vector |
| 1 | Reranker endpoint | Returns scores |
| 2 | Retriever unit | Full retrieval + reranking returns ranked documents |
| 2 | RAG pipeline | End-to-end retrieval → streaming generation with a sample query |
| 2 | Metadata filters | Three sub-tests against live Qdrant: single-field filter returns docs; valid multi-field AND returns docs; impossible AND combination triggers the priority-field safeguard and retries with the first `filterable_fields` entry only |

Step 2 (component checks) only runs if all Step 1 connectivity checks pass. Logs are written to `tests/health/logs/` with a timestamp for each run.

> **Note — Metadata Filters check:** requires `filterable_fields` to be configured in `params.cfg` and the Qdrant collection to have the corresponding payload fields stored as nested dicts (not JSON strings).
>
> The three sub-tests are hardcoded to a sample corpus — **you must adapt them to your own collection** before running. Open `tests/health/test_components.py` and update the queries and filter values inside `test_metadata_filters()`:
>
> | Sub-test | What to change | Example (agriculture corpus) |
> |----------|---------------|------------------------------|
> | 1 — single field | Query + one valid field/value | `filters={"crop_type": ["wheat"]}` |
> | 2 — valid AND | Query + two fields that co-exist in your data | `filters={"crop_type": ["maize"], "title": "Maize cultivation in the old and new lands"}` |
> | 3 — safeguard | Query + an impossible combination (valid value for field 1, non-existent value for field 2) so AND returns 0 and the retry fires | `filters={"crop_type": ["wheat"], "title": "Cultivation and producing Maize"}` |
>
> The priority field (used in the safeguard retry) is always the **first key in `filterable_fields`** in `params.cfg`.

### Running individual scripts

```bash
# Retriever + pipeline tests only (skips connectivity pre-checks)
python tests/health/test_rag_pipeline.py
```

`test_rag_pipeline.py` is for manual, qualitative spot-checks during development — inspect
logs to verify retrieval scores and response quality for specific scenarios.

Edit the `test_cases` list to add your own scenarios. The examples below use an
**agriculture knowledge base** as a reference — imagine a RAG system built on crop guides,
irrigation manuals, and farming practices. The scenarios themselves apply to any domain:
swap in questions relevant to your own corpus.

```python
test_cases = [
    # In-domain factual — system should retrieve and answer well
    ("factual_question", "What fertilizer is recommended for wheat in sandy soil?"),

    # In-domain summary — requires synthesising multiple docs
    ("summary_question", "What are the irrigation methods used for sugarcane?"),

    # Out-of-domain / hallucination risk — completely outside your corpus,
    # system should return a graceful no-answer rather than hallucinate
    ("out_of_domain", "What is the transformer architecture used in LLMs?"),

    # Ambiguous — underspecified, tests behaviour under low retrieval confidence
    ("ambiguous_query", "How do I grow it?"),
]
```

The `case_name` (first element) is used as a label in logs and the final pass/fail summary.
The hallucination risk warning fires automatically when the LLM gives a long answer despite
very low retrieval scores — a useful signal for out-of-domain queries.

## RAG Evaluation

The `tests/eval/` directory contains scripts to evaluate retrieval and reranking quality using an LLM-as-judge approach. Like health checks, these run locally outside Docker with the venv active from the repo root.

### How it works

Evaluation runs in two stages:

**Stage 1 — Retrieval** (`run_retrieval_only`)
Runs each question through the full retriever pipeline, capturing both raw vector search candidates and final reranked results. Output saved to `tests/eval/results/retrieval_eval_results.json`.

**Stage 2 — LLM Judging** (`run_evaluation_batch`)
Loads the retrieval results and uses the configured LLM to judge each retrieved document for relevance. Saves a judged report to `tests/eval/results/judged_eval_report.json`. Supports **checkpointing** — if interrupted, it resumes from where it left off.

### Setup

```bash
cd /path/to/chabo
source chabo_env/bin/activate
```

### Define your test questions

Edit `tests/eval/test_questions.py` to add your evaluation questions. Questions are organised into three subsets:

- **`standalone_questions`** — each query explicitly contains a filterable value; evaluated with no history
- **`history_blocks`** — conversation sequences where later turns rely on filter carry-forward; only the last turn per block is evaluated
- **`safeguard_questions`** — contradictory or unlikely field combinations that should trigger the AND-safeguard fallback

Each entry includes an `expected_filters` field used for ground truth filter checking (see [Filter Ground Truth Checking](#filter-ground-truth-checking) below). Set it to the filter dict you expect the LLM to extract, or `None` if no filter is expected.

These should be realistic queries representative of what actual users ask — curated with knowledge of your corpus. The examples below assume an **agriculture knowledge base**; replace them with questions and filter values relevant to your own domain:

```python
standalone_questions = [
    {
        "question": "What irrigation method is recommended for sugarcane on new land?",
        "expected_filters": {"crop": "sugarcane"},
    },
]

history_blocks = [
    {
        "turns": [
            "I'm looking for information about wheat crop management.",
            "What are the recommended pesticide applications?",
        ],
        "expected_filters": {"crop": "wheat"},
    },
]

safeguard_questions = [
    {
        "question": "What does the maize report on wheat fertilisation say?",
        "expected_filters": None,
    },
]
```

> **Note:** `test_questions.py` is for automated scoring via LLM-as-judge (`eval.py`).
> For manual qualitative spot-checks with categorised scenarios, use
> `tests/health/test_rag_pipeline.py` instead — the two complement each other.

### Run evaluation

Pass the `--mode` flag to select which stage to run, and `--filters` to enable metadata filter extraction:

```bash
# Step 1: Run retrieval and save results
python tests/eval/eval.py --mode retrieval

# Step 1 with metadata filter extraction and ground truth checking
python tests/eval/eval.py --mode retrieval --filters

# Step 2: Judge retrieved results with LLM (resumes from checkpoint if interrupted)
python tests/eval/eval.py --mode batch

# Step 2 with filters (judges the filtered retrieval results)
python tests/eval/eval.py --mode batch --filters

# Quick sample run (first 2 questions only, useful for testing)
python tests/eval/eval.py --mode sample
```

`--mode retrieval` is the default if no flag is provided.

Results are saved to `tests/eval/results/` (gitignored). The `--filters` flag appends `_filtered` to all output filenames — compare `judged_eval_report.json` vs `judged_eval_report_filtered.json` to measure the impact of filtering on retrieval quality.

### Filter Ground Truth Checking

When running with `--filters`, the extracted filters are automatically compared against `expected_filters` from `test_questions.py`. Two files are produced:

- **`retrieval_eval_results_filtered.json`** — full retrieval results, each entry includes a `filter_check` field with `expected`, `extracted`, and `result`
- **`filter_check_report_filtered.json`** — a dedicated report for at-a-glance inspection

The report is structured as follows:

```json
{
    "summary": {
        "total": 4,
        "score": 0.875,
        "score_note": "exact_match=1pt, partial_match=0.5pt, all others=0pt",
        "exact_match": 3,
        "partial_match": 1
    },
    "by_subset": {
        "standalone": { "total": 2, "score": 1.0, "exact_match": 2 },
        "history":    { "total": 1, "score": 0.5, "partial_match": 1 },
        "safeguard":  { "total": 1, "score": 1.0, "correct_none": 1 }
    },
    "details": [
        {
            "question": "...",
            "subset": "standalone",
            "expected": {"crop": "wheat"},
            "extracted": {"crop": "wheat"},
            "result": "exact_match"
        }
    ]
}
```

Possible `result` values:

| Result | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `exact_match` | Extracted filter matches expected exactly |
| `partial_match` | At least one field matches, others wrong or missing |
| `mismatch` | Filter was extracted but no fields match expected |
| `no_filter` | A filter was expected but none was extracted |
| `spurious_filter` | No filter was expected but one was extracted |
| `correct_none` | No filter expected and none extracted |

A console summary is also printed at the end of each `--mode retrieval --filters` run.
